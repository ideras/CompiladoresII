# Compilers II Class Code Examples

This repository contains code examples for a Compilers II class, demonstrating the usage of tools such as Flex, Bison, and Treecc. It also provides implementations of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Control Flow Graphs (CFGs).

## Tools Used

- **Flex**: A lexical analyzer generator.
- **Bison**: A parser generator.
- **Treecc**: An abstract syntax tree generator for C++.

## Contents

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Examples demonstrating how to use Flex and Re2C for lexical analysis.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Examples showing the usage of Bison and Lemon for syntax analysis.
3. **Tree Generation**: Implementation of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) using Treecc.
4. **Control Flow Analysis**: Examples demonstrating the construction of Control Flow Graphs (CFGs).

## Usage

Each directory contains standalone examples showcasing specific concepts. Follow the instructions in each directory's README.md file to build and run the examples.
